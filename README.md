# 🧠 FET312 - Brain Tumor Classification Project (DevTe213)

This repository contains deep learning models developed for the **FET312** course to detect brain tumors using MRI images. The project aims to compare the performance and accuracy of custom-designed CNN architectures against State-of-the-Art transfer learning models.

### 📂 Project Structure
The project consists of two main stages:

* **`FET312_DevTe213_CUSTOMCNNs` (Midterm Studies):** Contains the training and analysis of our custom-designed CNN models. Basic architectural experiments are located here.

* **`FET312_DevTe213_ADVANCED` (Final Studies):** This section includes advanced and pre-trained (Transfer Learning) models. Implementation codes for **ViT (Vision Transformer), ResNet50, VGG16, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet-B0**, along with the detailed **Project Report**, are located here.
